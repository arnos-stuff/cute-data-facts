# Hi 👋, I'm Shae !

Here's a short introduction about me:

## What I do

I'm currently working as a junior IT & Data Consultant somewhere in the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Bjj0AGm.png" class="cactus-link">very pretty</a> business hub of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/VMkGySJKihoE35At6" class="cactus-link">La Défense</a>, but I'm also trying to learn a bit more about programming and web development. I'm a self-anointed pythonista 🐍, but I'm trying to learn Julia & Javascript aswell !

I also work a lot with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" class="cactus-link">SQL</a> at my current job, though I'm eyeing on the recent trends like <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/" class="cactus-link">Snowflake</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery" class="cactus-link">BigQuery</a> 👀.

Here's a picture of my workplace (and <a href="3" class="cactus-link">some others I took in the area</a>):

## What I'm working on

I'm currently working on a few projects, but I'm not sure I'll be able to finish them anytime soon. I'm also trying to learn a bit more about web development, so I'm trying to make a few websites. Here's a list of the projects I'm currently working on:

| Number | Language | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 🐍 | A few unpolished <a href="https://pypi.org/user/arnos-stuff/" class="cactus-link">python packages</a> |
| 2 | 🐍/TS | A <a href="https://quasar.dev" class="cactus-link">Quasar Web App</a> with geostatistics and electoral analyses of polling stations (<a href="https://bureaux-vote.v.olt.sh" class="cactus-link">here</a>) |
| 3 | TS/Vue | A <a href="https://https://ionicframework.com/" class="cactus-link">Ionic App</a> for political compass quizzes |
| 4 | 🖥️🤖 | <a href="https://imgur.com/g5Cu2zH" class="cactus-link">A homelab / datalake</a> to learn GitOps / DevOps / Cloud things ! |
| 5 | 🤓 | A small <a href="5" class="cactus-link">blog about math related topics</a> when I feel like talking theory |


That's a lot ! But I also have some personnal matters ...

# The personal stuff

## I'm Autistic & Queer

I'm a proud <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-is-neurodiversity-202111232645" class="cactus-link">Aspie / Neurodivergent person</a>, I received an official diagnosis from  <a  class="cactus-link" ref="https://www.hopital-saint-anne.fr/"> Hôpital Saint-Anne</a> in Paris, France a year or so ago. They're considered a bit competent on the topic so I trust them.

</p>

I'm also most probably trans 🏳️‍⚧️, but I'm not sure 100% yet. I'm currently trying to figure out how to go about it, the process is a bit complicated in France, but it's a work in progress.

I wrote a short piece about the <a href="https://blog.shae.run/bayes-can-tell-you-youre-transgender" class="cactus-link">relationship between autism and gender diversity</a> a while back.

## I like games

I'm also a big video game player, so maybe we can play together sometime ! I'm currently a bit busy with work, but I'd love to share some factoids about my favorite games.

## I like music

I'm a HUGE music nerd, just to name a few of my favorite genres:

| Genre | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 70's rock | especially progressive rock and Cantebury scene / Krautrock bands |
| Bebop and Hard-Bop | The golden age of Bebop and Hard-Bop, especially the work of Miles Davis, who helped me bridge the gap between Jazz and Rock (I'm a huge fan of his work with John McLaughlin) |
| IDM | Especially the work of μ-Ziq, Floating Points, Squarepusher, and Boards of Canada |
| Hip-Hop | The classics, especially the work of MF Doom, Madlib, and J Dilla |
| Hyperpop | I'm a huge fan of the work of Charli XCX ! |
| K-pop | I've recently discovered I like K-pop thanks to League of Legends' KDA group, and I'm slowly getting into the genre  .. |
| Metal | I love Gojira obviously, but a lot of artists here and there, the progressive Metal scene is pretty dope aswell 🤩 |

... and many more 🎵

## I like math

I'm also a big math nerd, I'm currently trying to learn a bit more about statistics and probability theory, as I'm a recovering tentative PhD grad (I worked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference" class="cactus-link">Causal Inference</a> back in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Jiao_Tong_University" class="cactus-link">Shanghai</a>).

I'd love learning more, but I'm busy and already have a lot to do !
